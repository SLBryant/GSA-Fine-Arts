	<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Ariel; font-size: 22px; width: 60%; margin-left: 15px;">The Fine Arts Program manages GSA's Fine Arts Collection to ensure its safety, accessibility, preservation, and appropriate use in order to enhance and promote high-quality work environments for federal agencies and the public they serve.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Ariel; font-size: 22px; width: 60%; margin-left: 15px;">The Fine Arts Collection is one of our nation's oldest and largest public art collections. It consists of permanently installed and moveable mural paintings, sculpture, architectural or environmental works of art, and works on paper dating from 1850 to the present. These civic works of art are in federal buildings and courthouses across the United States. In addition, more than 20,000 small moveable New Deal works of art are on long-term loan to museums and other nonprofit institutions. Maintained by GSA as a part of our national and cultural heritage, the Fine Arts Collection serves as a reminder of the important tradition of individual creative expression.<p>
