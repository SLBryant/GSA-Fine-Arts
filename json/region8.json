(Kids of Survival) are internationally recognized for their collective art practice, which uses literary texts as the basis for their paintings and prints. Collaborating with students from local public schools and the Circle of Nations Wahpeton Indian School, Rollins + K.O.S. created a dynamic mural entitled EVERYONE IS WELCOME! FOR THE PEOPLE OF FARGO (after Franz Kafka) for the lobby of the Federal building and U.S. Post office in Fargo, North Dakota.\r\n\r\nAt studio workshops hosted by the Plains Art Museum, Rollins introduced the young North Dakota artists to Amerika, the comic novel written by Franz Kafka between 1911 and 1914. A wild urban fantasy of the immigrant experience, this coming-of-age novel chronicles the bizarre adventures of the young protagonist Karl Rossmann. After many trials and tribulations, Karl is ready to return to his homeland in humiliation when suddenly, at the end of the novel, he is recruited by a utopian commune whose motto is: \u201cEVERYONE IS WELCOME! EVERYONE IS AN ARTIST!\u201d excited to join the group, Karl is whisked away to a large stadium where he observes hundreds of women standing atop golden pedestals playing whatever music they choose on long golden horns.\r\n\r\nUsing this democratic vision as inspiration, Rollins called out to the Fargo students: \u201cshow your freedom, your individual voices, your spirits, in the form of a golden horn.\u201d The children sketched while talking about the novel and their lives, and listening to music by famous American jazz artists, such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Afterwards, Rollins took the students\u2019 drawings back to his studio in New York City, where he and K.O.S. created the final work of art based on the drawings. Actual pages of Kafka\u2019s novel were glued onto a stretched canvas, making the novel\u2019s text the conceptual and physical foundation of the painting, and then the final design was painted directly over this large grid of pages. The finished work is a vibrant gold and black painting that incorporates the horn imagery sketched by the individual children with visual references to the Fargo area: the railroad tracks and the shape of the Red River. \r\n\r\nBy inviting the students to contribute their imaginative talents, Rollins + K.O.S. created an artwork that functions both as a beautiful painting and as a collective memory of the students\u2019 participation in the workshops. And, for those entering the building, the mural illuminates a strong presence of community and individual spirit.","classification":"painting","creditLine":"Commissioned through the Art in Architecture Program\r\nFine Arts Collection\r\nU.S. General Services Administration","dimensions":"9' x 13'","artist":"Tim and K.O.S.

In the painting, Peter depicts a lush green field, the product of one of the nineteen thirties\u2019 fastest developing technologies: the irrigation system. During the dry years of the Great Depression, much of the farmland was rendered useless by drought, placing greater demands upon land still capable of cultivation. Extensive irrigation systems were vital to keeping crops alive and maximizing harvest. \r\n\r\nGeorge Peter was born in Munich, Vienna where he studied painting before immigrating to the United States in 1886 and seeking employment in the panorama painting business.  During their brief period of popularity, Milwaukee was the production center for the nation's panorama painting industry.  After his association with the American Panorama Company, Peter worked as a scenery painter for the Pabst Theater, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.   In 1912, George Peter began working for the Milwaukee Public Museum. He became the Art Director in 1923 and was well known throughout the museum profession for his creation of murals and dioramas for the museum\u2019s exhibits.","classification":"painting","creditLine":"Courtesy of the U.S. General Services Administration, Fine Arts Program","dimensions":"Image: 51 x 108 3/8 in.
